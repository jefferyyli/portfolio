			<p>During my internship at RBC Royal Bank, I was given the opportunity to lead a project from start to finish with other fellow co-op students, Daniel Kim and Emily MacGowan. The problem that we were given by our managers is that at RBC, many employees do not share their research findings and we wanted to figure out why that is happening and how we can solve that problem.</p>

			<!-- Pre-Discovery -->

			<h4 class="section-title">Pre-Discovery</h4>
			<p>During this phase, we wanted to understand the problem space before moving into the solution space. For our pre-discovery research, we wanted to understand:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> The possible users and stakeholders and understand their needs</li>
				<li> Documented the potential impact of success with our project</li>
				<li> The business goals associated with this problem space i.e. what value does this research add to RBC and why?</li>
				</ul>
			<p>While doing our pre-discovery research, we also found that there were other problems as well. We found that that there was a disconnect for every team with how they store documents and assets, and as well as sharing them with other employees. Once we felt that we did enough pre-discovery research we moved into problem framing phase to give us a starting point for our research.</p>

			<!-- Problem Framing -->

			<h4 class="section-title">Problem Framing</h4>
			<p>The purpose of this stage of is to unpack the problem space and craft a 'How might we'(HMW) statement with the team and stakeholders. At this stage, we hosted a problem framing workshop with our team (Employee Digital Experience Architecture). We started off our workshop by introducing the context of the project, goals and our pre-discovery research. Afterwards we gave the participants the following seed question:</p>
			<p class="quote">“What might be the biggest challenge when sharing research/insights and accessing existing research/insights?”</p>
			<p>The participants were asked to write down some of the challenges they face in their day-to-day lives at work on sticky notes. Afterwards Dan, Emily, and I clustered the stickies into common themes and the participants were given three sticky dots to vote for which challenges were most important to solve for.</p>
