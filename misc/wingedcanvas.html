			<h4 class="GDprojectDate">Illustration, Graphic Design</h4>
			<p class="GDprojectinfo">During the summer of 2016, I was interning as Graphic Designer/Jr. Art Director at Winged Canvas, a local art studio in the city of Markham. At the end of my internship, Winged Canvas was moving to a much larger and central location. I was tasked with creating posters and emails to inform people about the move. For this project, I decided to make a vector illustration to visualize the journey this company has gone through.<p>

			<h3 class="GDsubtitle" style="margin-top: 3em">Email &amp; Illustrations</h3></a>
			<p class="GDprojectinfo" style="margin-bottom: 2em">I worked with a copywriter to create the content and as well as use the copy to inspire my designs. We decided to use "Home is where the Art is" as copy to let people know that our amazing staff and stellar art nerd culture will be waiting for them at our new location! The road with different seasons and landscapes showed that this small company worked hard to get to where they are today. I decided to make the illustrations minimalistic and used a cartoony typeface because the main audience were children and parents.</p>
