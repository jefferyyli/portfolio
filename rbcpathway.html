				<!-- Background -->

				<div class="overview">
					<p class="project-desc">During my internship at the Royal Bank of Canada, I was given the opportunity to lead a project from start to finish with other fellow co-op students, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielkim5/" class="person" target="_blank">Daniel Kim</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilymacgowan/" class="person" target="_blank">Emily MacGowan</a>. The problem that we were given by our managers is that at RBC, many employees do not share their research findings and we wanted to figure out why that is happening and how we can solve that problem.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Pre-Discovery -->

				<div class="overview">
					<h3 class="project-title">Pre-Discovery</h3>
					<p class="list-desc">During this phase, we wanted to understand the problem space before moving into the solution space. For our pre-discovery research, we wanted to understand:</p>

					<ul>
						<li> The possible users and stakeholders and understand their needs</li>
						<li> Documented the potential impact of success with our project</li>
						<li> Outlined the business goals associated with this problem space i.e. what value does this research add to RBC and why?</li>
					</ul>

					<p class="project-desc">We did our research through informally asking employees about their current toolset and how they felt about it and as well as doing some secondary research online.</p>

					<!-- Remember to show evidence of the sheet -->


					<p class="project-desc">While doing our pre-discovery research, we also found that there were other problems as well. We found that that there was a disconnect for every team with how they store documents and assets, and as well as sharing them with other employees. Once we felt that we did enough pre-discovery research we moved into problem framing to give us a starting point for our research.</p>
				</div>

				<!-- Problem Framing -->

				<div class="overview">
					<h3 class="project-title">Problem Framing</h3>
					<p class="project-desc">The purpose of this stage of our project is to unpack the problem space and craft a 'How might we'(HMW) statement with the team and stakeholders. The resulting statement is actionable and will give us a starting point for our research and later ideating our solution. At this stage, we hosted a problem framing workshop with only our team (Employee Digital Experience Architecture). This was a limitation in our process as this workshop could be a bit biased as our team are comprised of only designers, researchers, and usability experts (although these would be our primary users). We started off our workshop with introducing our participants with the context of the project, goals and our pre-discovery research. Afterwards we gave the participants the following seed question:</p>

					<p class="quote">“What might be the biggest challenge when sharing research/insights and accessing existing research/insights?”</p>

					<p class="project-desc">The participants were asked to write down some of the challenges they face in their day-to-day lives at work on sticky notes. Afterwards Dan, Emily, and I clustered the stickies into common themes and the participants were given three sticky dots to vote for which challenges were most important to solve for.</p>

					<div class="projectMock"><img class="projectMock" src="images/RBC_Pathway/pathway1.jpeg"></div>
					<p class="caption">The resulting groupings/themes from the problem framing session include: context, redundancy in work, awareness, efficiency, challenging your research, finding research, organization, sharing/cultural, technical, quality/reliability.</p>


					<p class="list-desc">After the votes were tallied up, two challenges were tied with the highest amount of votes. The challenges with the most votes were:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>How might we make sure insights reach the people it would be most relevant to
						<LI>Finding the research
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class="overview">
					<h3 class="proj-subtitle">Initial HMW Statement</h3>

					<p class="project-desc">As we were running out of the time in the framing workshop, the team was not able to craft a HMW statement together. Instead Dan, Emily, and I crafted the HMW statement the following work day and later discussed it with our colleagues via email so we would have an alignment for our HMW statement. This is the first draft of our HMW statement:</p>

					<p class="quote">How might we foster a community of RBC researchers to share relevant information with one another so that they can make more well-informed decisions?</p>

					<p class="project-desc">We initially assumed that the researchers at RBC wanted to be a part of a community. We need to do some research to understand how RBC employees currently share information within the organization and if they are motivated or desire to be a part of a community. We also included 'relevant information' in the HMW statement as well as we know that when using other's research, it must be relevant to the context including the time (e.g. our team would be careful with using secondary research from 3+ years ago as the research would be stale). We also assumed that researchers could make better decisions or research conclusions if they are aware of other research or leveraging knowledge from within the organization. For example, in academia, research is often replicated to ensure validity.</p>

				<!-- Research Phase -->

				<div class="overview">
					<h3 class="project-title">Research Phase</h3>

					<p class="project-desc">During the research phase we conducted primary interviews and gathered secondary research to understand researchers’ experiences finding, storing, sharing and using both internal and external research.</p>

					<h3 class="proj-subtitle">Primary Research – Interviews</h3>
					
					<p class="project-desc">We conducted interviews with 16 RBC employees. Due to time and budget constraints, we were connected to other colleagues in similar teams and job roles (although we looked at the employee database and reached out to other RBC employees that would fit our criteria for research but only one has agreed to be interviewed). Our sample size was not diverse which has limited us and has given a bit of a bias. Sample roles that were interviewed included UI/UX Designer, Developer, Design Thinking Coach, UX Consultant and Product Manager.</p>

					<h3 class="proj-subtitle">Secondary Research</h3>
					
					<p class="project-desc">After conducting interviews, we wanted to dig deeper based on the information we discovered through the interviews. We wanted to understand how users shared information across enterprises, barriers to knowledge sharing, and extrinsic/intrinsic motivations on why people share. We looked through research papers, case studies, articles, and wrote down interesting findings on sticky notes and added them to our synthesis wall.</p>

					<div class="projectMock"><img class="projectMock" src="images/RBC_Pathway/pathway2.jpeg"></div>
					<p class="caption">As RBC did not have a dedicated workspace for researchers and designers, we went on multiple floors and rooms to do our affinity diagramming (this took us a while as we had to take them down and put them back up).</p>

					<h3 class="proj-subtitle">Research Findings</h3>
					<p class="project-desc">Our primary and secondary research was summarized and clustered into themes using a research method technique known as affinity diagramming. This technique helped us organize our data points into meaningful and manageable themes.</p>

					<div class="projectMock"><img class="projectMock" src="images/RBC_Pathway/pathway3.jpeg"></div>
					<p class="caption">We ended up stealing a touch-down room and stayed in there for five days until we were kicked out.</p>

					<p class="project-desc">Here are some sample insights that we crafted from the data we synthesized:</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle2">Insight #1</h4>
					<p class="project-desc">RBC researchers rarely share the context and process for their research, instead they primarily share their polished research in the form of artifacts such as personas, insight statements, and PowerPoint Presentations.</p>

					<h4 class="subtitle2">Insight #2</h4>
					<p class="list-desc">Researchers looking for information are skeptical about using primary research conducted by other employees because it:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>might not be relevant to their context
						<LI>they may not trust the other researcher’s methodologies
					</ul>

					<h4 class="subtitle2">Insight #3</h4>
					<p class="project-desc">Sharing is not a proactive part of the design process. Researchers primarily share when there is a request from another individual or team.</p>

					<h3 class="proj-subtitle">Problem Re-frame</h3>
					
					<p class="project-desc">After synthesizing our research and crafting insight statements we re-framed our initial problem statement based on our primary and secondary research. This is our revised problem statement:</p>

					<p class="quote">How might we enable RBC researchers to more easily and proactively document their research, and feel comfortable in doing so, so that other researchers can leverage the output and/or further their design process?</p>

					<p class="project-desc">At RBC, we discovered that sharing is not a proactive part of the research and employees typically only share when there is a request. We were also told that researchers and designers care about confidentiality and convienence when it comes to storing their work. Reseachers are also more likely to use existing research if they know how relevant it is in today's context, if the source is reputable and if the context is close to their own.  Researchers are also skeptical about trusting work completed by other RBC researchers because of a number of different factors (e.g. researchers feel that other researchers at RBC do not follow methods properly or do not use a similar process). Researchers at RBC also arely share the entire context or process of their own research. Instead, they primarily share their research in polished forms of artifacts such as PowerPoint presentations, personas, and insight statements.</p>

					<h3 class="proj-subtitle">Primary Persona</h3>

					<p class="project-desc">A primary evidence-based persona was developed using the research we conducted as a team. In this persona we outlined user goals, behaviours, current pains, values, tools used and their needs and desires with respect to finding, sharing, using and documenting research. This is a draft of our persona and will be continuously developed with further research in the future when the project is handed over to next team that will work on this project. </p>

				<!-- Ideation -->

				<div class="overview">
					<h3 class="project-title">Ideation</h3>

					<p class="project-desc">Due to time and budget constraints, we were not able to hold an ideation workshop with participants. Instead we hosted an ideation session with just Emily, Dan and I. We started the ideation session by generating ideas solo. We took some time to generate some ideas and generate some low-fi mockups. Later, we shared our ideas with eachother, gave feedback, and listed pros and cons of each proposed solution. Afterwards we took the best ideas and pulled them into the final solution. While thinking about the solution, we made sure to reference insight statements, the persona, research themes, and the revised HMW statement.</p>

				<!-- Prototype -->

				<div class="overview">
					<h3 class="project-title">Prototype</h3>

					<p class="project-desc">Because of the time we had left before our internships ended, we only had a limited time to design our screens and flows. Ideally more sketching and brainstorming should've been put into this phase of our project. We wanted to keep our screens simple, minimal, and clean. We used the RBC Visual Design guidelines to help us create a colour palette and as well as following the icons and CTAs RBC used.</p>

					<p class="project-desc">During the ideation session, we struggled with thinking how to solve the third insight: "Sharing is not a proactive part of the design process. Researchers primarily share when there is a request from another individual or team." We didn't want to make another another database of documents as we have already saw that it did not work at RBC (there was a database of research on RBC called Thinkr which no one uses or has heard of). My UX Design Professor taught us that users are lazy so we tried to figure out ways to assist designers and researchers with making the process of sharing much more easier and seamless. Our solution to this problem was creating a "project tree" to help users easily document the research process and sharing that process with other researchers and stakeholders across the bank.</p>

					<div class="projectMock"><img class="projectMockWhite" src="images/RBC_Pathway/projecttree.jpg"></div>
					<p class="caption">High-Fidelity Mockup of the Project Tree</p>

					<p class="project-desc">In the project tree, users are able to document "Stages" and "Methods". "Stages" (the larger box filling the full width of the container) refer to a key step in the design process such as pre-discovery or research synthesis while "Methods" (box filling half the width of the container) refers to a method used during that "stage" such as problem framing in the pre-discovery phase or conducting interviews in the research phase.</p>

					<div class="projectMock"><img class="projectMockWhite" src="images/RBC_Pathway/projecthelp.png"></div>
					<p class="caption">This box will appear when you hover over the "?" icon and will give the user info on that certain design process or method.</p>

					<p class="project-desc">We also wanted to further the design field at RBC (which at the time we were there, was underdeveloped). Very few teams at RBC were educated about user research and design thinking so we wanted to help employees learn more about these processes so that they can create better products and make better decisions. On this web app, we created a resources page where users can find suggested books, how-to's, and guides on research methods and processes. On the project tree, on both methods and stages, users are able to hover over the "?" icon to learn more about a certain process or method. When creating a new method or stage on a project tree, we have preset stages and methods that would link back to resources page.</p>

					<div class="projectMock"><img class="projectMock" src="images/RBC_Pathway/projectstep.png"></div>
					<p class="caption">When typing in a process or method, we give preset suggestions to the user.</p>

					<p class="project-desc">The great thing about this feature is that we were able to educate users on design processes and methods if they didn't know how to create a research plan for their project. We also had different preset templates for the users if they had no knowledge on research to guide them in the right direction. Users were also able to create their own templates or duplicate trees so that they can document their research much faster.</p>

					<div class="projectMock"><img class="projectMock" src="images/RBC_Pathway/projecttemplate.png"></div>
					<p class="caption">Users are able to select any preset templates for their project tree.</p>

					<p class="project-desc">As mentioned previously, we didn't want to make Pathway look and feel like a database or else no would want to use it. We wanted make Pathway to look more simlpe and easy to navigate so we made the "Find Projects" page filled with projects on cards. This way it would much easier for the user to find what they are looking for. On this page, your feed is filled with suggested projects based on what the user has liked and on the user's preferences (users select what they are interested in when they first sign up). As Pathway is a new product there would be no projects at all so we decided that this page would be not be the landing page until projects start filling up. </p>

					<div class="projectMock"><img class="projectMockWhite" src="images/RBC_Pathway/findprojects.png"></div>
					<p class="caption">Users can find suggested projects or search on the "Find Projects" page.</p>

					<p class="project-desc">At RBC, employees are under a team that is under an area of the bank (e.g. I was under Employee Digital Experience Architecture which is under Enterprise Architecture). On Pathway, users are able to create teams with their respective colleagues and can collaborate more easily on their project trees. Users are also able to find teams and follow them as well and get updates when a team or individual has made a change to their projects or shared their work.</p>

					<div class="projectMock"><img class="projectMockWhite" src="images/RBC_Pathway/projectsteam.png"></div>
					<p class="caption">On the team profile, you can see who's on that team and projects they've worked on.</p>

				<!-- User Flows -->

				<div class="overview">
					<h3 class="project-title">Site Map &amp; User Flows</h3>

					<p class="project-desc">Because of the time we had left before our internships ended, we only had a limited time to design our screens and flows. Ideally more sketching and brainstorming should've been put into this phase of our project. We wanted to keep our screens simple, minimal, and clean. We used the RBC Visual Design guidelines to help us create a colour palette and as well as following the icons and CTAs RBC used.</p>
